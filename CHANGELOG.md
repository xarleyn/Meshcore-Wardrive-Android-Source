# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- An app-wide offline banner now detects restricted or unavailable internet
  access with a short periodic connectivity check. GPS tracking, radio
  communication, and local sample storage continue while offline.
- Successful pings heard by at least three positioned repeaters now show a
  temporary grey radio-position estimate and its uncertainty circle. The
  estimate is visually distinct from the blue GPS position.

### Fixed
- Update checks now time out quickly and show a concise offline error instead
  of leaving the request hanging.
- Android location fixes now use the fused provider so GPS, cellular, and
  nearby Wi-Fi positioning can work together.
- Very inaccurate fixes and probable in-flight samples are ignored without
  blocking legitimate drives on high-altitude roads.
- Tracking startup failures now show a specific permission, settings, or
  service error.

## v1.0.42 - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Tropospheric Ducting Forecast**: View 6-day VHF/UHF ducting forecast maps from dxinfocentre.com. Select from 23 global regions, scrub through 28 forecast frames (3h intervals for first 36h, 6h intervals after), pinch to zoom, and animate with playback controls. Region selection persists between sessions. Access from Settings under the Atmospheric Ducting section.

## v1.0.41.1 - 2026-07-09

### Fixed
- **Community Coverage Download**: Now works with Cloudflare live map (sharded KV format). Fetches all shards in batches for full coverage download.
- **Community coverage colors**: Cells now use green/yellow/red quality colors instead of solid blue
- **Tap community cells**: Tap any community coverage cell to view success rate, repeaters (with RSSI/SNR), sample count, and last update
- **Clear community data**: Trash icon on the Community Coverage toggle to delete cached data

## v1.0.41 - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **#22 Community Coverage Download**: Download coverage data from your configured web map for offline viewing. Go to Settings → Data Management → "Download Community Coverage" to fetch, then toggle "Community Coverage" in map layers to show coverage from all community wardrive data.

### Fixed
- **#27 Permissions/ping failure on fresh install**: Fresh installs of v1.0.40 created the samples table without the `device_id` column, causing all sample inserts to fail silently. Coverage squares and pings appeared to not work. Fixed `_onCreate` schema and added defensive error handling around device tracking.
- **#24 Static GPS Blue Dot**: GPS blue dot was only updating every 5 seconds (on the timer-driven `_loadSamples` cycle). Now updates in real-time via `setState()` on every GPS position update.
- **#23 Coverage boxes reverting to red**: Cells with confirmed coverage (at least one successful ping) will no longer drop below yellow, even if subsequent drives through the area fail. Only cells with zero successful pings show as red.

### Technical
- `_onCreate` now includes `device_id` column and `devices` table for fresh installs
- Device tracking `upsertDevice()` call wrapped in try/catch to prevent cascade failures
- Position stream listener now triggers `setState()` for immediate blue dot movement
- Coverage color logic floors at 30% success rate when `received > 0`

## v1.0.40 - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Device Tracking & Comparison**: The app now logs which LoRa companion device (by Bluetooth ID and name) you use for each wardrive session. View all paired devices and their performance stats in the new Device Comparison screen (Settings → Data Management). Compare two devices side-by-side: success rate, fail rate, total pings, unique cells, avg response time, avg SNR, and avg RSSI.
- **Dead Zone Alert Toggle**: New setting to enable/disable the "Entering known dead zone" notification
- **New Repeater Alert Toggle**: New setting to enable/disable the new repeater discovery notification

### Fixed
- **New Repeater Discovery Alert**: Now only fires for repeaters that have truly never been seen before in the database. Previously the in-memory set reset on every app restart, causing false "new" alerts. Known repeater IDs are loaded from sample history on startup.

### Technical
- Database version 11 → 12: new `devices` table, new `device_id` column on samples
- `LoRaCompanionService`: captures connected device ID (BT remoteId for Bluetooth, product name for USB)
- All ping samples (distance, time, and carpeater) tagged with `device_id`
- `DatabaseService`: device CRUD, per-device stats queries (success rate, avg SNR/RSSI/response time, unique cells)
- New `device_comparison_screen.dart` with device cards and side-by-side comparison table
- `SettingsService`: `deadZoneAlertsEnabled` and `newRepeaterAlertsEnabled` toggles

## v1.0.39 - 2026-06-08

### Added
- **Multiple Ignore Repeaters**: Comma-separated list support for ignoring multiple repeater prefixes at once
- **Live Notification Stats**: Foreground notification now shows real-time success rate, ping count, and distance (e.g., `✅ 85% | 📍 247 pings | 🛣️ 12.3mi`)
- **Repeater Contacts in JSON Export**: Discovered repeaters now included in unified JSON exports
- **Privacy Zones**: Define circular exclusion areas on the map — data inside zones is stripped from uploads and exports. Long-press to add, manage via Settings menu
- **New Repeater Discovery Alert**: Sound + snackbar notification when a never-before-seen repeater is discovered during wardriving
- **Dead Zone Alerts**: Vibration + snackbar warning when entering a previously-mapped dead zone (throttled to once per cell per session)
- **Battery Saver Mode**: Automatically doubles ping interval when device battery ≤20%, restores at >30%. Shows orange "🔋 Saver" badge in control panel
- **Coverage Redundancy View**: New "Redundancy" color mode showing repeater count per cell (green=3+, yellow=2, orange=1)
- **Coverage Score**: New Score tab in Analytics — single shareable number computed from `uniqueCells × successRate × freshness` with letter grade (S/A/B/C/D)
- **Wardrive Achievements**: 14 milestone badges (First Ping, Kilopinger, Road Warrior, Mesh Master, etc.) with unlock notifications and dedicated Achievements screen
- **Repeater Downtime Detection**: Repeater Health screen now flags repeaters not seen in 7+ days (with 10+ total pings) with offline icon and day count
- **Quick Settings Gesture**: Double-tap the tracking FAB to show a floating overlay with ping distance, timeout, and mode dropdowns for quick adjustments

### Technical
- Database version 10 → 11: new `privacy_zones` table
- New `achievement_service.dart` with SharedPreferences-based badge tracking
- New `achievements_screen.dart` with progress bar and unlock history
- Added `battery_plus` dependency for device battery monitoring

- `AggregationService`: new `redundancy` color mode branch
- Analytics: new Coverage Score tab with share button, 5-tab bottom nav
- Repeater Health: `isOffline`/`daysSinceSeen` fields, offline badge in app bar

## v1.0.38 - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Planned Repeater Markers**: Long-press anywhere on the map to place a marker for a potential repeater location. Add an optional label, tap to view details or delete. Markers persist in the database.
- **Delete Mode**: Remove bad data before uploading. Activate from Data Management menu, then tap a coverage square to delete all samples in that cell, or tap individual sample dots to remove one at a time. Red banner shows when active.
- **Planned Repeaters menu entry**: Shows marker count with option to clear all markers

### Fixed
- **Show Successful Pings Only toggle**: Was incorrectly writing to map rotation setting instead of the filter. Now works correctly and persists across restarts.

### Technical
- Database version 9 → 10: new `planned_markers` table
- `DatabaseService`: added marker CRUD methods, `deleteSample()`, `deleteSamplesByGeohash()`
- `SettingsService`: added `showSuccessfulOnly` persistence + export key
- Map long-press handler for marker placement
- Delete mode routing in sample and coverage tap handlers

## v1.0.37.1 - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **Coverage gaps eliminated**: Removed `_pingInProgress` guard from distance-based pings, restoring v1.0.33 behavior. Distance pings now fire immediately on every threshold trigger, allowing overlapping pings for dense coverage. Each ping uses a unique discovery tag so responses correlate correctly.
- **Rate limit fully removed**: No artificial delay between pings — `_pingInProgress` is only used for time-based ping deduplication, not distance pings.

## v1.0.37 - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- **Coverage gaps eliminated**: Rate limit reduced from 30s to 5s — at 50m distance pings, coverage squares are now continuous with no large gaps
- **Coverage resolution setting**: Changing precision now properly invalidates the aggregation cache and rebuilds the map
- **Web map wrong success rates**: GPS-only samples (no ping attempted) are now filtered from uploads — previously they inflated failure counts on the live map
- **Prediction rings blocking taps**: Rings now render behind coverage squares and repeater icons so they don't intercept touch events
- **Lock rotation persistence**: Map rotation lock setting now persists across app restarts

### Added
- **Ping time interval 5s and 10s options**: Time-based ping interval dropdown now includes 5s and 10s for more aggressive coverage in "Both" mode

### Improved
- **Map performance when zoomed in**: Auto-follow throttled to every 2 seconds (was every GPS update ~1/sec), distance/speed updates no longer trigger full map rebuilds, and the 5-second refresh skips setState entirely when nothing changed
- **Carpeater message passthrough**: Confirmed that received/sent messages work while in carpeater mode (by design — logged into the repeater)

### Technical
- Auto-follow uses `_autoFollowInterval` throttle to reduce `_mapController.move()` calls
- Distance/speed stream listeners update values silently without setState
- `_loadSamples` no-change path compares all state fields before calling setState
- Upload service filters `pingSuccess == null` samples in both single and multi-endpoint paths
- Web map `samples.js` also skips GPS-only samples in `aggregateSamples()`

## v1.0.36 - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Carpeater stale neighbours**: Neighbour table is now cleared before each discovery cycle. Previously the repeater returned cached neighbours from its home location even when driving far away, causing false green coverage squares.
- **Empty gray coverage boxes**: Coverage cells with only GPS-only samples (no pings) are no longer rendered. Eliminates the gray boxes that appeared between ping samples, especially at short distance intervals.
- **Settings export**: Now offers Save to Folder or Share options (was share-only)
- **Ping timing reverted**: Discovery timeout back to 20s default, rate limit back to 30s (v1.0.33 behavior) to reduce false dead zones from aggressive timeouts

### Added
- **Session restore on import**: JSON exports now include session history alongside samples. Importing restores both — no more losing session records on reinstall. Backward compatible with old export files.
- **Carpeater cycle interval "None"**: New option for back-to-back discovery cycles with zero gap between them

### Improved
- Carpeater settings UI: renamed "Discovery Interval" to "Cycle Interval" with descriptive subtitle
- Data import handles both new unified format (`{samples, sessions}`) and legacy format (plain sample array)
- Import shows session count in result message when sessions are restored

### Technical
- `WSession` model: added `toJson()`/`fromJson()` for session serialization
- `DatabaseService`: new `exportAllData()` and `importAllData()` methods for unified export/import
- `AggregationService`: filters out coverage cells where all samples are GPS-only (`pingSuccess == null`)
- `CarpeaterService._runDiscoveryCycle()`: calls `_clearPreviousNeighbours()` before each discovery

## v1.0.35 - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Multi-Device Wardrive**: Merge coverage data from multiple users into one map
  - `source` field on samples identifies which device/operator collected the data
  - Device Name setting in Settings for tagging your exports
  - Multi-file import with merge summary dialog (shows source, count, overlap)
  - Filter by Source in Data Management to view data from a specific contributor
- **Repeater Health Dashboard**: Dedicated per-repeater analysis screen
  - List view with sortable repeater cards (reliability, response time, ping count, alerts first)
  - Degradation alerts: warning icon when 7-day success rate drops >15% vs 30-day average
  - Tap-to-drill-down detail page per repeater:
    - SNR over time line chart
    - Weekly success rate bar chart
    - Best/worst time of day breakdown
    - Last 20 ping results history
  - Alert count chip in app bar
- **Settings Export/Import**: Backup and restore all app preferences as JSON
  - Export via share sheet (includes upload endpoints, carpeater config, display settings)
  - Import with confirmation dialog — wardrive data is not affected
  - Useful for reinstalls and sharing configs with MeshCore communities
- **Carpeater Mode (Beta)** label with v1.14+ firmware requirement hint
- **Manual ping sound/vibration feedback** — matches auto-ping behavior

### Fixed
- **Device position command**: `CMD_SET_POSITION` was using code 20 (battery request) instead of 14 (lat/lon) — pings now route correctly through the mesh
- **Auto-ping lock**: `_pingInProgress` flag could get stuck permanently, blocking all future auto-pings (now uses `finally` block)
- **Carpeater toggle mid-tracking**: Enabling/disabling carpeater in settings now properly starts/stops the service and resumes auto-ping
- **Session history filter**: Selecting a session no longer fails to update the map (aggregation cache bypass)
- **Carpeater self-filtering**: Target repeater automatically excluded from neighbour results (no need to add to ignore list)
- **USB disconnect detection**: Pulling USB cable now properly disconnects and disables auto-ping (mirrors Bluetooth handler)
- **Stream controller leak**: `_disconnectController` now closed in `dispose()`
- **SQLite WAL pragma**: Fixed `execute` → `rawQuery` for Android compatibility

### Improved
- **Sound**: Switched from `STREAM_NOTIFICATION` to `STREAM_MUSIC` for reliable audio playback
- **Vibration**: Uses `USAGE_ALARM` VibrationAttributes to bypass Samsung touch vibration setting
- Sound and vibration enabled by default for new installs
- **Ping timing**: Rate limit reduced from 30s to 5s, default discovery timeout from 20s to 8s
- **Both mode dedup**: Time-based pings skip if a distance ping fired recently
- **Aggregation caching**: Skips full recomputation when sample/repeater count unchanged
- **SQLite WAL mode** for better concurrent read/write during wardriving
- **Ping rate limit enforced**: Actually waits cooldown instead of just logging
- **Advertisement map cleanup**: Stale entries pruned every 5 minutes
- **Upload JSON deduplicated**: Extracted shared `_samplesToJson()` method

### Technical
- Database version 8 → 9: new `source` column on samples with index
- New `repeater_health_screen.dart` (~670 lines)
- `SettingsService` extended with `exportSettings()`/`importSettings()` and `device_name`
- `LoRaCompanionService`: added `_handleUsbDisconnection()`, `ignoredRepeaterPrefix` getter, advert cleanup
- `MeshCoreProtocol`: `CMD_SET_ADVERT_LATLON = 14` (was incorrectly `CMD_SET_POSITION = 20`)
- Native `MainActivity.kt`: `STREAM_MUSIC` audio, `USAGE_ALARM` vibration attributes, debug logging

## v1.0.34 - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Faster Carpeater Mode**: Reduced discovery wait from 30s to 8s for v1.14+ repeaters
- **Offline Map Tile Downloads**: Download tiles for current view area with zoom range picker
- **Disconnect Stream**: LoRaCompanionService exposes disconnect events for USB and Bluetooth
- **Auto-Ping Auto-Disable**: Auto-ping and Carpeater automatically stop on device disconnect

### Improved
- Sound and vibration feedback enabled by default
- Carpeater service hardened: safer stop logic, `_isStopped` guard, improved retry counts and delays
- Map screen performance: conditional re-aggregation only when sample/repeater counts change, repeater deduplication
- Upload service refactored: extracted `_samplesToJson` helper, cleaner JSON construction

### Technical
- New `SoundService` with platform channel (`mintylinux.wardrive/feedback`) for native audio/haptic feedback
- New `TileDownloadService` for offline tile management
- Added `VIBRATE` permission to AndroidManifest
- Protocol constant renamed: `CMD_SET_POSITION` → `CMD_SET_ADVERT_LATLON`
- `MainActivity.kt` extended with ToneGenerator and Vibrator support

## v1.0.33 - 2026-03-29

### Added

## v1.0.29 - 2026-02-27

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Reinstall Required
The app package name has changed from `com.example.meshcore_wardrive` to `mintylinux.meshcore.wardrive`. Android treats this as a completely different app, so you **must uninstall the old version** before installing v1.0.29.

**Before updating:**
1. Open the app and go to **Settings → Export Data** to back up your samples
2. Uninstall the old version
3. Install v1.0.29
4. Go to **Settings → Import Data** to restore your samples

### Added
- **Editable Upload Sites**: Upload endpoint addresses can now be edited (previously only deletable)
  - Blue edit icon next to each site in Manage Upload Sites

### Changed
- **Package name**: Changed from `com.example.meshcore_wardrive` to `mintylinux.meshcore.wardrive`

## v1.0.28 - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **Configurable Discovery Timeout**: Users can now adjust ping timeout from 10-30 seconds in 5-second intervals
  - Default: 20 seconds (changed from hardcoded 30)
  - Available options: 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s, 30s
  - Accessible in Settings menu under "Discovery Timeout"
  - Different network conditions and repeater densities may benefit from different timeout values
  - User feedback indicated 30s timeout was too long in some scenarios, causing worse results
  - Shorter timeouts work better in dense repeater areas, longer timeouts help in sparse coverage

### Changed
- Default discovery timeout changed from 30 seconds to 20 seconds
- LocationService now dynamically reads timeout setting instead of using hardcoded value

## v1.0.27 - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **WhisperOS Device Support**: Devices running WhisperOS now appear in Bluetooth scan list

## v1.0.26 - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Ping Timeout**: Increased ping timeout from 20 seconds to 30 seconds to respect repeater rate limits
  - Repeaters are rate-limited to 4 responses per 120 seconds (30 seconds between responses)
  - Previous 20-second timeout could trigger pings too quickly at highway speeds
  - New 30-second timeout ensures at least 60 seconds between pings (30s travel + 30s timeout)
