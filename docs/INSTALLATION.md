## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to install" error
- Make sure you have enough storage space (need ~100MB free)
- For an update, make sure the APK has the same application ID and signing
  certificate as the installed app, and a higher build number
- Restart your device and try again

### Permissions denied
- Go to Settings → Apps → MeshCore Wardrive → Permissions
- Enable all required permissions manually

### App crashes on startup
- Clear app data: Settings → Apps → MeshCore Wardrive → Storage → Clear Data
- Reinstall the app
- Make sure your Android version is 7.0 or higher

## Updating

To update to a new version:
1. Download the new APK
2. Install over the existing app (data will be preserved)

Do not uninstall first unless you intentionally want a clean installation.
Uninstalling deletes the app's settings and collected wardrive data. If Android
rejects the update because its signing certificate differs, export or back up
important data before uninstalling the old app.

## Uninstalling

1. Go to Settings → Apps → MeshCore Wardrive
2. Tap **Uninstall**
3. Or long-press the app icon → App info → Uninstall

Note: Uninstalling will delete all your collected wardrive data.
